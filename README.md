# Jets program

## Description
This Jets program allows the user to manage a fleet of jets by creating a text file that contains information on each jet, including model, range, speed, and price. The program then reads the file and converts the data into an ArrayList in the AirField class. The user is then prompted with a menu of different actions they can choose from, such as listing the jets in the fleet, flying all planes, and adding or removing jets. Finally, when the user chooses to exit the program, they will receive a message before the program ends.

## Tech used
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Abstract Objects
- Interfaces
- ArrayLists
- if, else if, and else statements
- Constructors
- BufferedReader and FileReader
- For loops and while loops
- Wrapper classes


## Learning Outcomes

During the development of this project, I gained experience with:

- Applying object-oriented programming principles in Java, including encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstract objects
- Implementing interfaces to define and implement common behavior across multiple classes
- Working with input/output in Java, including reading from and writing to files using FileReader and BufferedReader
- Using methods to organize code and accomplish specific tasks, and passing arguments to methods to provide them with necessary data
