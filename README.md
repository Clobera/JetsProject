# Jets program

### Description
In this jets program we are tasked with creating a text file of different jets with models, range, speed, and price. We then read the file and turn its contents into an object that we will store in an Array List in the AirField file. Next, then prompt the user with a menu of different actions they can choose from (ex. list jets in fleet, fly all planes, add and remove jets, and more!). Finally, when the user chooses to exit the program they enter the option in the menue and they will be left with a message before the program ends.

### Lessons learned
<li>  I learned that making methods for different tasks makes your code cleaner and is easier to work with when troubleshooting. 
<li> Another lesson i learned was to work with fields that are private by using methods.
<li> i also learned how to search for answers i didn't know!
